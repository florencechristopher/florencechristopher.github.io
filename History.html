<div class="History">
<h1>History of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity</h1>
<p>Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young 
   African-American male students. The Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable 
   Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, 
   scholarship, and service.<br> </p>
<p>The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as “a part of” the 
   general community rather than “apart from” the general community. They believed that each potential member should be 
   judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence…without regard to race, nationality, skin tone 
   or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be 
   devoted to the “inclusive we” rather than the “exclusive we”.<br></p>
<p>From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta 
   Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively 
   for themselves and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills 
   to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity’s motto, “Culture For Service 
   and Service For Humanity”.<br></p> 
<p>Today, Phi Beta Sigma has blossomed into an international organization of leaders. No longer a single 
   entity, members of the Fraternity have been instrumental in the establishment of the Phi Beta Sigma National Foundation, the Phi 
   Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union and The Sigma Beta Club Foundation. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, founded in 1920 with the assistance of 
   Phi Beta Sigma, is the sister organization of the Fraternity.</p>
